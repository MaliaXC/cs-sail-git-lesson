In this simple exercise, you will create a new branch, a new file, edit the file, push the commit, and make a pull request.

### Making a new branch and moving to that branch

```
git checkout -b your_name
```
After you create your branch, check if you are in your branch:

```
git branch
```

Great job! Any changes you make now will not affect the master branch directly!
Now that you are in your branch, let's create a new file!
There are easier ways to create a file, but we are gonna use command prompt.

You will create a file & write your name into it at the same time.

To do so, type:

```
echo your_name > your_name.txt
```

Alternatively, you can create the file first by typing:

```
touch your_name.txt
```

and typing your name in later.
